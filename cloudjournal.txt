Today, i decided to start the 100 hours aws project bootcamp.
- I've setup gitpod which i usd my sister's linkedin because i'm too young for linkedin. 
- I've also setup github, and i just downloaded vscode.
- I've signed up for all the tools needed to complete this bootcamp.

- I watched a few lessons on aws billing, and i setup my iam users to have access to billing.
- I created a budget in aws to alert me when spend is above $0 and i also created an alert to monitor spend and send EMAIL alerts using SNS.
- Today i found out that there is an actual difference between IAM identity center and IAM. I've been using IAM identity center all this while.
